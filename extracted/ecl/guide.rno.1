Installation Guide for TOPS-20 ECL
.s.p
The accompanying 9-track tape is written at 1600 BPI in TOPS-10 BACKUP
format. I intend to include two full copies of the system (in successive
"save sets") in case there are difficulties reading one.
.p
The pseudodevice designator "ECL:" is treated specially when
encountered at the beginning of a file name. It is assumed to refer
to the directory
that has been chosen as the ECL library area.  The system
you are getting has been initialized with "ECL:" defined to be
"PS:<CHEATHAM-1>".  When you have decided where the system files will
live, you should reinitialize and save ECL as follows:
.s.nf
(connect to ECL library directory)
RUN ECL
POKE(ECLDIR, "new-directory-designator");
LOADB "TRAP";
(system will exit to monitor level)
SAVE ECL.EXE <esc><esc><ret>
.f.p
In addition to mapping explicit uses of "ECL:" to the special
library directory, ECL expects to find its error message file ECLSYS.ERR
and the version of TECO invoked by the TECO and MAKE routines
(called ANTE.EXE) in that area.
.p
MAKECL.ECL is the file that was used to initialize ECL.EXE originally.
Looking at it, you will note that the unparser (UP) and environment
back-tracer (BT) are the only library packages resident in the basic
system.  You may choose to LOADB others before saving your own
version.
.p
ECL has been used successfully under versions of TOPS-20
through version 4. Since it makes use of the TOPS-10 compatibility
package, only the first six file name characters and the first three
file extension characters will be significant in file designators,
and generation numbers are not allowed. Directory names such as
<MUMBLE> are correctly parsed and translated, however.
.p
The version of TECO used with ECL is called ANTE.  It is a pure
TOPS-20 program, invoked by ECL as an inferior fork.  It can
also be run as a stand-alone editor from monitor level.  The
file ANTE.DOC describes the differences between ANTE and
standard TECOs.
